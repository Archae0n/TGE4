#TODO
#done# -add code for alternate gender
#done# -check what happens if a leader is created via event. result: on_action doesn't trigger. this is bad
#
#idea: create leader and delete leader after the gender of the other leaders have been changed to refresh the gui
#and to avoid reloading the savegame. It seems this doesn't work for rulers. result: delete leader need a break of one day
#idea: clone leader and exile leader for saving data from leader before they are elected
#done#-test change_leader_portrait(current portrait to robot to current). result: this works properly if on day pass after changing the portrait to robot
#I can add this to avoid the reloading after changing the ruler/heir gender
#-are ther issues with non gender species
