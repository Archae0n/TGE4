In time the fleets faced many shortages that took strong and Autocratic leadership to sort out which still lasts to this day."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_OLIGARCHY_NOMADS:0 "Space called by many the final frontier, but to us we call it home. We once lived a planet-bond life but events known only to us caused us to leave. We built new and better voidcraft to house our people nanocomposite hulls and cabling become more natural to us than worlds of green.\nUpon taking our new void bound life A system was put into place where the captains of a ship has the final say in matters aboard them. However for matters that concern the fleet a board was created of the best and more skilled captains to handle such matters which has persisted to this day."

We built new and better voidcraft to house our people nanocomposite hulls and cabling become more natural to us than worlds of green.\nThough adapting to the void was not easy. We have not forgotten that even though the captains have the final say on what happens on their ship they are elected by the crews that man them. And in turn all capable crews men have a say in how the fleet is ran by a majority vote. This system has lasted to this day."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ADMIRALTY_BOARD:0 "Since our species took to a more nomadic life it was our admirals that stepped up to lead our people; After several disasters that almost cost us the fleet. And to this day we are governed by a Board of our best and brightest Admirals."

We built new and better voidcraft to house our people nanocomposite hulls and cabling become more natural to us than worlds of green.\nIt has been a long time since our species has settled for a space borne existence in this resource rich system and the bounty that raiding other empires has given us. However after many years inter clan warfare a Khan has arisen from our ranks to lead us to glory."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_BLACK_ADMIRALTY:0 "Space called by many the final frontier, but to us we call it home. We once lived a planet-bond life but events known only to us caused us to leave. We built new and better voidcraft to house our people nanocomposite hulls and cabling become more natural to us than worlds of green.\nWhen our people took to space they faced many hardships and made many hard choices such as raiding ships of weaker empires to survive. And thus the role of the Admiral of the Black was made, from the first who carved that title from our own waring fleets. Now united under the Black Admiral we will strike out against those empires who dare get in our way."

We built new and better voidcraft to house our people nanocomposite hulls and cabling become more natural to us than worlds of green.\nWhen our people took to raiding other space faring nations, A loose confederation of sorts was made, the Brethren court and the code have been the leading government of our people for the longest time. However the court has convenid and elected a new [Root.GetRulerTitle] to unite the court against all others and to rake in the loot that comes from more organized raids."

We built new and better voidcraft to house our people nanocomposite hulls and cabling become more natural to us than worlds of green.\nWe have since not regretted this decision for those who live in the void, one false move and missing part means death with only the strongest surviving. However after many interstellar conflicts with the gangs, clans, and houses that make up our civilization something odd happened. All factions aggreed on a system of majority vote which only capable raiders are able to cast a vote, This system of voting has continued to this day."

The experiment caused the [GetSpeciesName] to stop fighting...then they stopped working, then talking, breed, and finally stopped feeding themselves and just lay there to die. However a 10th of a percent had an opposite reaction and their aggressor response increased beyond simple madness they have done things that should never be described as they hunted down those who did not feel the full effects of the experiment.

WELL IT WORKED! well...to well 90% percent of the population stoped fighting...then they stopped everything else; Working, talking, breeding, and eating. An entire species let itself die...Our only legacy is the 10% percent who remained who had an opposite response whos aggressor response increased beyond madness. They killed those who where not effect and those who were not under the full effects of the PACKS and have done things that no sentient should ever have to describe a sad end and terrible new beginning for my species...OH NO!<Gets attacked by a member of own species with scars, open wounds, and metal inserted in flesh who did not wait for his victim to be dead before eating them.> recording ends... And the hunt begins."
