 ehl_event.20.desc:0 "Our scientists report new insights regarding the galactic hyperlane network. \nThey state that hyperlanes, like all things in the cosmos are not completely static. It appears they grow with time. They note that pulsars appear to influence hyperlanes, yet the exact nature of how remains to be answered. \n\n§YHyperlanes around pulsars seem quite unstable and may disconnect from nearby stars.§! \nHowever our recent advances in HyperDrive technology makes it theoretically possble, to manipulate the hyperlanes to an extent."
