patronmoon.100.desc:0 "The project is complete. The transportation of the servants, plants and animals provided enough biomass to meld into the consciousness of a new patron. In hours it comsumed the entire surface, growing and starting to create a mental link with everyone on the planet. The presence spread across the surface and made sure to catch all those that were against it. They were the first to become the new servants of its glory and power. We are part of it now. We hear our master above us. His whispers in our heads when we wake, work, sleep and share intimate moments. It speaks to us. §RIt's hungry.§!"

The inhabitants of the moon have struggled up until the very last moment to try and flee or fight back the expansion of our Patron...hypocrites! They should have been honored to have become part of our master's body, alas, it's not our time to join them...not yet. The new embodiment of our Patron has already established a psychic link with all the other living moons in the galaxy and we are ready to serve it with the same vehemency of its original form. Unfortunatly, even with our best efforts, the new Patron moon is still young and hasn't reach its full potential yet...§Rit's still hungry§!"

Thanks to our advanced technology, not doubt fruit of our Patron's inspiration, we were able to propagade our master's biomass without the need of a solid moon as a base! With the aboundant supplies of food we have filled the habitat of [Root.GetName] with, our Patron was able to grow and expand up until engulfing completely the habitat's structure! The new embodiment of our Patron has already established a psychic link with all the other living moons in the galaxy and we are ready to serve it with the same vehemency of its original form.

He helps, he gives advice, he teaches. We are as much part of it as if it was in our genome. His power expanded over the system. He feels everything in the system. Tells us in detail if we want to know. We speak, we discuss, we share even our most intimate moments. Those unwilling to do so are sent away. They will not be part of this collective. They will join others unwilling to cooperate in creation of a new patron moon. All will serve. §RMaster is still hungry.§!"

patronmoon.108.desc:0 "The power of the will swept aside all doubts. The patron moon that gave us protection for so long has reached his final form. Its power dwarfs even the power of the initial patron. What the first of their kind provided hides in the shadow of this newfound power. We bask in the glory as the tenderils graze the surface, accepting offerings in flesh. We are one with it. It is with us at any moment now. We are one with our patron and its power is beyond even our strongest psychics. He knows all, he sees all, he feels all... §RHe's hungry.§!"

As the icecaps melt, the crystalline formations shatter and the presence is felt again we ecstatically join the celebrations. Our master is satisfied. He expeced its
children to wake him up despite all the odds against us. We bow, we fall to the ground, we cheer. But we know what must happen now. Those caught in attempts to stop
us will be first. After all. The best thing after one wakes up is... §RA nutritious snack.§!"

patronmoon.125.name:0 "Patron Frozen"
patronmoon.125.desc:0 "The sin of those foolish enough to attempt stopping our glorious plans is beyond understanding. They encased our master in ice shell. Their pathetic abilities not
enough to cause any harm to it. Stalling is not going to save them. We will reach them. We will smite them down and awaken our master once more. And they will see
that he is not picky when it comes to the source of his nutrition. In their foolishness they chose to become part of his great plan. Their choices brought it upon
themselves."

The mass of earth, rock, plants, animals and the bodies of those lucky enough to contribute to it is sent to the orbit. The ground shook as the matter flew up. People screamed in joy, fear, ecstasy. All shall be honoured to join the new master in its physical form. The power of the new patron moon is not yet at its full potential, but its whispers are heard across the planet. We are with it once more. It is a part of us, as it should, and it will lead us to the glory. But it still has potential to §R grow. Expand. Consume.§!"
