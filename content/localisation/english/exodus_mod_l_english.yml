 START_SCREEN_EXODUS:0 "[GetSpeciesNamePlural] have always been driven to grow and prosper. As long as we have ruled [GetHomeWorldName], the steady pace of progress has continued. Our great cities grew until the whole planet was covered. Yet the day many ignored has arrived all the same: we are on the brink of running out of resources. Once-great stockpiles lie empty. The deepest wells have run dry.\n\nThe local solar system has been tapped, but it is not enough. All our hope is placed in the breakthough discovery of the hyperlane network. It is imperative that the [GetName] venture outward now. [GetHomeWorldName]'s dwindling resources will soon be too scarce to support future expeditions- let alone the sustain the [GetAdj] race."
