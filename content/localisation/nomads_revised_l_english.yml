 NOMAD_FOOD:0 "Resource Module: Arcology Horticulture"
 NOMAD_FOOD_DESC:0 "Produces: §Y12§! £food£\n\nBy necessity, an Arkship is effectively an Arcology in space. In light of this, researchers determined that the most efficient means of feeding the population would be through extreme efficiency in crop growth. Depending on the demands of the species, these facilities are designed to maximize space in return for the most efficient produce possible. These facilities are constantly upgraded and maintained through a variety of resources and are tailored to suit the needs of the people."
 
 NOMAD_ENERGY:0 "Commercial Framework Module: Multi-Thread Management"
 NOMAD_ENERGY_DESC:0 "Produces: §Y12§! £energy£\n\nA combination of different economic factors have produced the need for citizens on Arkships to define exchangable mediums in different ways. Thanks to the inherent need of an Arkship to be able to replace most if not all of its own components with outsourced materials, currency has been relegated to an energy allotment per citizen. This Module is specifically designed to compute the various requests from citizens as well as to manage the fuel reserves and power generation available on the Ark. Generators as well as supercomputers are present within the Module."

By exploiting the nature of reality on either very small (sub-quantum) or very large scales, powerful effects can be achieved that partially fold and reshape reality onto itself, allowing the manipulator to transmute matter into energy and energy into matter. This effect allows flawless materials to be made out of previously useless chunks of rock. Energy itself is the foundation of the future."

 NOMAD_CG_1_DESC:0 "Produces: §Y12§! £consumer_goods£\nUpkeep: §Y12§! £minerals£\n\nThe Fabrication Module is designed to act as a massive foundry where anything that the citizenry requires can be produced. Ranging from durable, nondurable, or pure services, these goods are built from the raw materials gathered and housed in the Resource Module, then distributed to the citizens via the Commercial Framework Module. The way this is presented to the citizen varies on the culture and customs - a mall, a silo, a slot in the wall, it all depends on the ideation of the civilization."
 
 NOMAD_CG_2:0 "Fabrication Module: Citizen Needs LV2"

 NOMAD_UNITY_1_DESC:0 "Produces: §Y6§! £unity£ £society£\nUpkeep:§Y4§! £consumer_goods£\n\nThe nature of this complex is one of Arkship governance. It is designed to act as the nerve center of the Ark, and houses vast arrays of computers, sensors, monitors, and other feedback equipment that allows the people charged with ensuring the smooth flow of operations to get all the data they need at their fingertips. Due to the nature of Arkship life, new systems are built that automatically adopt job titles, document routing, and training programs to the latest changes in local government policy. The net result is a more cohesive civilization that flows more readily to the ever changing circumstances of Arkship life."
 
 NOMAD_UNITY_2:0 "Government Complex: Cultural Invertics"
 NOMAD_UNITY_2_DESC:0 "Produces: §Y15§! £unity£ £society£\nUpkeep: §Y1§! £rare_crystals£, §Y10§! £consumer_goods£\n\nThe additional knowledge gained of the sophisticated interplay between citizens and large group structures has given way to the realization of cultural invertics. Originating from a messy but captivating collision of political science, crowd heuristics, and cultural phase shifts, a knowledge of cultural invertics better places a society to both understand and, more importantly, provoke behavioral change on a massive scale in order to suit the needs of the Arkship."
