 NOMAD_LABS_1:0 "Research Module: Xenology Archive"
 NOMAD_SCIENCE_T1:0 "Research Module: Xenology Archive"
 NOMAD_LABS_1_DESC:0 "First contact with alien beings has caused an explosive development in branches of study as diverse as linguistics, anthropology, biology and sociology. To combat this lack of data, this research module is specifically designed to cope with those needs and provides for basic laboratory equipment through which the population of the Ark can study the stars."

 NOMAD_LABS_3:0 "Research Module: Advanced Non-Baryonics"
 NOMAD_SCIENCE_T3:0 "Research Module: Advanced Non-Baryonics"
 NOMAD_LABS_3_DESC:0 "This Research Module is dedicated to the exploration of the nature of anti-particles, coupled with a better understanding of the effects of polarity and time on non-baryonic matter. This Module represents the beginning of insight into all greater forms of matter; everything is strange and new in these places, from the math required to understand it to the Module necessary to contain it."

 NOMAD_MINERALS:0 "Resource Module: Matter Exctraction And Storage"
 NOMAD_MINERALS_DESC:0 "Resource Units represent the general material wealth that is extracted from stellar bodies. These Modules are specifically designed to break down larger pieces of matter into their base atomic components, then placed into a hydrostatic container separated based on atomic weight for later use and processing. This Module also houses the necessary automated or manned craft required to extract materials from local space."
 
 NOMAD_FOOD:0 "Resource Module: Arcology Horticulture"
 NOMAD_FOOD_DESC:0 "By necessity, an Arkship is effectively an Arcology in space. In light of this, researchers determined that the most efficient means of feeding the population would be through extreme efficiency in crop growth. Depending on the demands of the species, these facilities are designed to maximize space in return for the most efficient produce possible. These facilities are constantly upgraded and maintained through a variety of resources and are tailored to suit the needs of the people."
 
 NOMAD_ENERGY:0 "Commercial Framework Module: Multi-Thread Management"
 NOMAD_ENERGY_DESC:0 "A combination of different economic factors have produced the need for citizens on Arkships to define exchangable mediums in different ways. Thanks to the inherent need of an Arkship to be able to replace most if not all of its own components with outsourced materials, currency has been relegated to an energy allotment per citizen. This Module is specifically designed to compute the various requests from citizens as well as to manage the fuel reserves and power generation available on the Ark. Generators as well as supercomputers are present within the Module."
 
 NOMAD_ALLOY_T1:0 "Production Module: Plasma Metallurgy"
 NOMAD_ALLOYS_1:0 "Production Module: Plasma Metallurgy"
 NOMAD_ALLOY_T1_DESC:0 "This Module is specifically deisgned to handle the high level production and refinement of base alloys and other component construction. Under carefully-controlled conditions, the application of extremely high temperature currents through molten metallics can produce metal plasmas. These substances form the basis of all hard material components built within this Module."

 NOMAD_ALLOY_T2:0 "Production Module: Matter Manipulation"
 NOMAD_ALLOYS_2:0 "Production Module: Matter Manipulation"
 NOMAD_ALLOY_T2_DESC:0 "This Production Module is capable of creating high order localized fields to bend matter, while also serving as a storage medium for the refined product. As knowledge of crystal lattice structures improves and mining and refining technologies advance, resources can be exploited in previously impossible ways for production of high end durable materials."

 NOMAD_ALLOY_T3:0 "Production Module: Replication Industrialization"
 NOMAD_ALLOYS_3:0 "Production Module: Replication Industrialization"
 NOMAD_ALLOY_T3_DESC:0 "By far the most sophisticated industrial complex on the Ark, this Module is specifically designed to replicate matter on truly vast scales. By exploiting the nature of reality on either very small (sub-quantum) or very large scales, powerful effects can be achieved that partially fold and reshape reality onto itself, allowing the manipulator to transmute matter into energy and energy into matter. This effect allows flawless materials to be made out of previously useless chunks of rock. Energy itself is the foundation of the future."

 NOMAD_CG_T1:0 "Fabrication Module: Citizen Needs"
 NOMAD_CGS_1:0 "Fabrication Module: Citizen Needs"
 NOMAD_CG_T1_DESC:0 "The Fabrication Module is designed to act as a massive foundry where anything that the citizenry requires can be produced. Ranging from durable, nondurable, or pure services, these goods are built from the raw materials gathered and housed in the Resource Module, then distributed to the citizens via the Commercial Framework Module. The way this is presented to the citizen varies on the culture and customs - a mall, a silo, a slot in the wall, it all depends on the ideation of the civilization."

 NOMAD_UNITY_T1:0 "Government Complex: Adaptive Bureaucracy"
 NOMAD_UNITY_1:0 "Government Complex: Adaptive Bureaucracy"
 NOMAD_UNITY_T1_DESC:0 "The nature of this complex is one of Arkship governance. It is designed to act as the nerve center of the Ark, and houses vast arrays of computers, sensors, monitors, and other feedback equipment that allows the people charged with ensuring the smooth flow of operations to get all the data they need at their fingertips. Due to the nature of Arkship life, new systems are built that automatically adopt job titles, document routing, and training programs to the latest changes in local government policy. The net result is a more cohesive civilization that flows more readily to the ever changing circumstances of Arkship life."

 NOMAD_UNITY_2:0 "Government Complex: Cultural Invertics"
 NOMAD_UNITY_T2_DESC:0 "The additional knowledge gained of the sophisticated interplay between citizens and large group structures has given way to the realization of cultural invertics. Originating from a messy but captivating collision of political science, crowd heuristics, and cultural phase shifts, a knowledge of cultural invertics better places a society to both understand and, more importantly, provoke behavioral change on a massive scale in order to suit the needs of the Arkship."
